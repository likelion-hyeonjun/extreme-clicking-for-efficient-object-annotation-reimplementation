# Reimplementation of extreme clicking for efficient object annotation reimplementation (ICCV 2017)

# Introduction

The purpose of this repository is to provide a reimplementation of the algorithm described in "Extreme clicking for efficient object annotation" (https://arxiv.org/abs/1708.02750) which generates a pseudo mask from extreme points.
